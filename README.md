Summary
MapServer is a system for developing web-based GIS applications. The basic system consists of a CGI program that can be configured to respond to a variety of spatial requests like making maps, scalebars, and point, area and feature queries. Virtually all aspects of an application, from web interface to map appearance can be developed without any programming. For the more ambitious user, MapServer applications can be enhanced using Python, PHP, Java, JavaScript or many other web technologies. For more information and complete documentation please visit:
